                                          MY WEB PORTFOLIO SITE
Doing the portfolio was really amazing and interesting.

This is because i really got to understand better how to code from mockups which is a very important in todays industry.

Talking of challenges, apart from trying to code and bring out an identical website as my mockup,

i aslo faced problems with content. As you can see in the design, the images used there are mostly place holders.

Im hoping as time goes on i will able to better design and develop more websites more efficiently. 

Another down side i noticed in this project was my inability to manage time properly which is very key in the industry and so i need to work on it.

Also in this portfolio piece i challenged myself to showcase all what i have been thought in this program; from photography, to video production, to webdesign and finally  web development. I also tried to showcase my ability to use Adobe in a proffessional way.

And this really posed a challenge to me, but not withstanding i beleive i was able to the best of my abilities showcase them and hope to do better in the near future.

Another important thing i got to learn while studying and working on this project was coding terminologies and how important it is
to use it in the code to give myself a better brand in the web development industry.

Having acquired some knowledge on Boostrap also went a long way in helping me accomplish this project.

Overall the project was an interesting one especially because of the challenges i faced and overcame while working on it. It was really an eye opener on many things.

While celebrating my effort i also  have strongly at the back of my mind that this is not my best work and i can do better, so i will keep working harder and studying more to improve my skills 
on web design and development.
